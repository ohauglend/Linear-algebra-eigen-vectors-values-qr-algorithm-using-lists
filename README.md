# Linear-algebra-eigen-vectors-values-qr-algorithm-using-lists
Replicated selected functionalities from NumPy's linear algebra library, implemented using lists. Among other operations: computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, using the qr-algorithm.

As a project for our foundations of data science class I decided to replicate selected functionalities from NumPy's linear algebra library, implemented using lists. The most advanced in the code is the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, using the qr-algorithm, but the script also includes:

Matrix multiplication
Matrix row reduction
Matrix determinant, inverse and transposed
LU-decomposition for solving linear equations on matrix form
Other selected operations on matrices and vectors
